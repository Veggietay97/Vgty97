# Final Project: Mini_Piano

The project is a modification of the Lab5.
Instead of making a wailing siren, it produces a piano sound based on the switches on the board.

Piano key notes:
* SW0: C
* SW1: D
* SW2: E
* SW3: F
* SW4: G
* SW5: A
* SW6: B
* SW7: Pre-programed music box(haven't implement yet)

Possible future implementations:
* Sharp notes
* Music box
